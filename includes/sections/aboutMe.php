    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <div>
        <p>So how did I get into software development?</p>
        <p>Well, after being told by my manager to fill out my timesheet one too many times, I decided to try and write a Python script that would do the work for me. So one Saturday, after 8 hours of researching and coding, I eventually came up with something that worked. After my success, I began thinking that maybe I could do this for a living. So I went back to school and the rest is history.</p>
        <p>Currently, I live in the Bay Area, CA. Rent's expensive, but I love the weather.</p>
        <p>During my free time, I enjoy messing around with my computer, watching movies and TV shows, playing video games, and attempting to exercise.</p>
